- **Impact**: More accurate memory planning

### 6. Concurrency Improvements

#### Thread Safety

print(f"Connection pool: {db_info['connection_pool_size']}")
print(f"Active connections: {db_info['connection_pool_checked_out']}")

# Model manager status
status = model_manager.get_system_status()
print(f"Loaded models: {status['models']['loaded_count']}")
print(f"Total memory: {status['models']['total_memory_gb']}GB")

# Queue status
queue_status = inference_manager.get_queue_status("model_name")
print(f"Queued requests: {queue_status['queued_requests']}")
print(f"Active requests: {queue_status['active_requests']}")
```

### Debug Logging
```python
# Enable debug logging for performance analysis
logging.getLogger('mlx_gui.database').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
logging.getLogger('mlx_gui.model_manager').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
logging.getLogger('mlx_gui.inference_queue_manager').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

## üìù Implementation Notes

### Breaking Changes
- Database schema updates require migration
- Cache invalidation on settings changes
- Thread pool configuration changes

### Migration Guide
1. Update database with new indexes
2. Clear existing caches on first run
3. Monitor performance metrics
4. Adjust cache TTL values based on usage patterns

### Troubleshooting
- **High Memory Usage**: Check for memory leaks in model loading
- **Slow Database**: Verify indexes are created and connection pooling is working
- **Queue Delays**: Check queue processing frequency and worker threads
- **Cache Issues**: Verify cache TTL settings and invalidation logic
